Pull the raw `Gen` out of a synthesized `CorrectGen` term by rewriting with the `extract` simp
set, which holds one `.val` equation per synthesis combinator. Unlike delta-reduction via
`withReducible (reduce ·)`, this unfolds exactly the combinator wrappers and nothing else, so
the combinators don't need to be `@[reducible]`.

/--
`generator_search P` closes a `Gen α` goal with a generator whose *support* is exactly `P` — it can
produce every value satisfying `P`, and nothing else. `P` may be a `Prop`-valued predicate or a
decidable `α → Bool`, including a recursive one over any `derive_palamedes`d datatype.

```lean
def genEq2 : Gen Nat := by generator_search (· = 2)
```

One modifier:

* **`allow_partial`** skips the totality check, admitting a generator that still contains a
  `Gen.assume` — i.e. one that *filters*. Such a generator can fail when sampled (the sampler does
  not backtrack), so this is opt-in. Needed by `genAVL` and `genRBT`.

A synthesized generator ships uniform, which diverges for a static- or growing-seed generator like
`genWellTyped`. To weight it, run `derive_tuning` on it and sample `<gen>.tuned θ` at a `Tuning`
(e.g. `SchedulePolicy.stlc.materialize <gen>.sites`). Support is unaffected by the weighting.

Totality failure is a *warning*, not an error.
